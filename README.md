# Kokoa Clone 2020 Update

Welcome to the Kokoa Clone 2020 Update! This project was created as a learning exercise to help me improve my HTML and CSS skills.

## Technologies Used

To create this project, I primarily used HTML and CSS. I did not use JavaScript in this project, but I plan to learn it in the future and incorporate it into my projects.

## Viewing the Project

To see the final result, please visit [Geoffrey's Kokoa Clone](https://mochafreddo.github.io/kokoa-clone). Note that the webpage is optimized for a resolution of 414 x 896, so I recommend adjusting your browser to mobile size or switching to device mode in developer mode to get the best viewing experience.

## Assignments

As part of the course that I took to learn HTML and CSS, I completed several assignments. You can find the completed assignments in the `assignment` folder of this repository. Each assignment does not have a separate README file, but you can find screenshots of the completed work in the folder.

## Future Improvements

While I'm proud of what I've accomplished with this project, there are always ways to improve. In the future, I plan to add more dynamic features using JavaScript and potentially explore using other technologies to make the site even more engaging.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my project! I hope you enjoy it.
